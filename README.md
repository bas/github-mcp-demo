# Langton's Ant Simulation

Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. In a grid of cells (initially all white), an "ant" moves according to the following rules:

1. At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
2. At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

Despite its simple rule set, the ant's path eventually develops a recurring "highway" pattern of repeating movements.
